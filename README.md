# Training XLM-RoBERTa with Hugging Face on Google Colab

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to fine-tune the XLM-RoBERTa model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The notebook uses the CoNLL-2003 dataset and trains the model on Google Colab.

## Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify named entities (such as people, organizations, locations, etc.) within a given text. This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune the XLM-RoBERTa model, a powerful multilingual language model, for NER using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Setup
The notebook starts by installing the required dependencies, including `datasets`, `seqeval`, and `evaluate`.

## Dataset Preparation
The notebook uses the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which is loaded using the `datasets` library. The dataset is then tokenized and aligned with the NER labels using the XLM-RoBERTa tokenizer.

## Model Initialization and Training
The XLM-RoBERTa model is initialized with the pre-trained weights, and the number of labels is set based on the dataset. The model is then fine-tuned using the Hugging Face Trainer API, with customizable training arguments.

## Model Evaluation
The notebook defines a custom `compute_metrics` function to evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset using the `seqeval` metric.

## Saving and Loading the Model
After training, the model and tokenizer are saved to disk for future use. The notebook also demonstrates how to load the saved model and tokenizer.

## Example Usage
The final section of the notebook provides an example of how to use the fine-tuned model to perform Named Entity Recognition on a given input text.
